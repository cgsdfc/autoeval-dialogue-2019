            Context & anyone knows why my stock oneiric exports env var ' **unknown** I mean what is that used for ? I know of \$USER but not \$USERNAME . My precise install doesn't export USERNAME . looks like it used to be exported by lightdm , but the line had the comment " // **unknown** : Is this required ?" so I guess it isn't surprising it is gone . thanks ! How the heck did you figure that out ?  https://bugs.launchpad.net/lightdm/+bug/864109/comments/3 . \\
